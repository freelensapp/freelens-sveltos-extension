# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

> **Tip**: If you find yourself correcting the agent during interactive work, suggest adding a new rule to this file so the lesson is captured for future sessions.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Freelens extension that brings the official Sveltos
dashboard (<https://github.com/projectsveltos/dashboard>) to Freelens. It reads
the ProjectSveltos custom resources (`config.projectsveltos.io`,
`lib.projectsveltos.io`) and the ClusterAPI `Cluster` directly from the
management cluster, and adds a "Sveltos" group to the cluster sidebar with an
overview, a dashboard of the clusters and their add-ons, and a page per kind.
`README.md` lists the pages and the supported APIs. The Freelens extension docs
(`docs/extensions/` in freelensapp/freelens) define the API contract, and this
file the build, type-check and test patterns around it, each with its reason.

- **Language**: TypeScript 7.x
- **Runtime**: Node.js >= 24.0.0, Freelens ^2.0.0 (extension API v2), the
  `engines` of `package.json`
- **Toolchain**: Node.js 24.x, yq 4.x and cosign 3.x (`mise.toml` with
  `mise.lock`; Node also in `.nvmrc`)
- **Package manager**: pnpm 12.x (`packageManager`, run through corepack)
- **License**: MIT

Library and tool versions follow the Freelens stack exactly: the catalog in
Freelens's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for libraries, the root `package.json` scripts
of Freelens for tools run with `pnpm dlx` (Biome, knip, Trunk launcher), and
Freelens's `mise.toml` and `.nvmrc` for Node and the other mise tools.
Renovate keeps them there: custom datasources in `.renovaterc.json` read the
versions from the same Freelens files on `main`, so an update arrives only once
Freelens has adopted it, at that version, in one `Freelens dependencies` group
PR together with a release of `@freelensapp/extensions`. A dependency added to
`package.json` follows the Freelens catalog unless the catalog rule excludes
it; one that Freelens does not have must be excluded there, or its lookup fails
on the Dependency Dashboard. The catalog rule matches only `dependencies` and
`devDependencies`, so an override copied from Freelens's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
such as `@kubernetes/client-node>@types/node`, is otherwise looked up on npm
and runs ahead of Freelens. Such an override gets a rule of its own, next to
the catalog rule: `matchManagers: ["npm"]`, the override's key in
`matchDepNames`, `overrideDatasource: "custom.freelens-catalog"`, the overridden
package in `overridePackageName`, and the catalog rule's `rangeStrategy`,
`minimumReleaseAge` and `groupName`
(freelensapp/freelens-for-claude-extension@f2f49241828f201890423e070655c2dc04120b23).
This repository has no override. What Freelens does not define (GitHub Actions, the
tool versions in the workflows, `shx`) Renovate updates as usual.
pnpm is the exception: Renovate updates it from the npm registry, in a pull
request of its own, and not to the version of Freelens's `packageManager`.
`packageManager` carries a Corepack hash (`+sha512.…`), and Renovate updates
the hash only from the digest of the new version, which the registry has and a
custom datasource does not; without it the update fails with "no valid digest
available".
`mise.lock` pins a checksum and a URL per tool for all eight platforms; after
changing `mise.toml`, run `mise lock` (not only `mise install`, which re-locks
just the current platform). `mise.lock` is lockfile revision 3
(`lockfile_version = 3`), which needs mise 2026.9.16 or newer; older versions
reject it. `@freelensapp/extensions` is
a devDependency in the range of the Freelens release line (`^2.0.0`). The
libraries the host provides at runtime (`react`, `react-dom`, `mobx`,
`mobx-react`, `monaco-editor`) and their types are devDependencies only, for
compiling and testing; `electron` is a devDependency for its types only. The
one entry of `dependencies`, `yaml`, is bundled into main, which parses the
kubeconfig and the Helm release of a managed cluster with it.

pnpm settings live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. A dependency runs its install
scripts only when `allowBuilds` sets it to `true`; a new dependency with
install scripts that is not listed there fails `pnpm install`, so add it with
`true` or `false` deliberately. pnpm refuses versions younger than its
`minimumReleaseAge` (1 day), with `@freelensapp/extensions` excluded because
a Freelens release is adopted on the day it is published, together with the
stack it was built with. An exact version that Freelens lets in early for a
security fix, such as `electron@44.10.0`, is excluded here too, with the same
comment, so that the update installs; the entry goes once the version is
older than the policy.

`strictPeerDependencies: true` makes `pnpm install` fail when the extension's
own copy of a shared library is outside the peer range that
`@freelensapp/extensions` declares for it: `react`, `react-dom`,
`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `mobx`, `mobx-react`, `monaco-editor` and
`electron`. These peers are optional, so they are checked only when the
extension declares the library, which it does for every one it imports or
compiles against. Without the setting pnpm reports a mismatch as one warning
line and installs anyway. Freelens does not set it, because its own tree takes
these libraries from its catalog, which defines the ranges; an extension
declares its own copies, and these peers are the only place where they are
compared with the versions the host runs. The types are peers as well, so the
package's declaration compiles against the extension's own `@types/react` and
`@types/react-dom`, one copy of each, and the package does not install them for
it. An extension with renderer code declares both: the declaration imports its
React types from `react` and `react-dom`, and the renderer's JSX and component
props are checked against them. A main-only extension needs neither; its code
reaches no React type, and `skipLibCheck` leaves the declaration's own imports
unchecked.

An extension that renders `Renderer.Component.MonacoEditor` compiles against
`monaco-editor` without importing it, so it declares `monaco-editor` in
`devDependencies` at the host's version as well. `MonacoEditorProps` takes its
`options` and callback types from that package; without it they are `any`, and
`skipLibCheck` hides the unresolved import. This extension renders one for the
values of a Helm release (`src/renderer/components/helm-release-view.tsx`) and
declares it ("The host-provided libraries, and how to mark them
external" in Freelens's `migrating-from-v1.md`, and contracts C3 and C11 of
`api.md`).

```

Build output goes to `dist/`: `main.js`, `renderer.js` and `renderer.css`, with
source maps. `main` and `renderer` in `package.json` point at the two entries.

### The main process

Main serves the cluster frames over the channels of
`src/common/ipc-channels.ts`, with one handler each in the `Main.Ipc` of
`src/main/index.ts`: the latest Sveltos release, the chart logos, the Helm
release of a managed cluster, and the metadata filter and dashboard layout,
which main reads from and writes to the preferences store. A handler finds its
payload among the arguments by its shape (`findChartIconRequest` and the
like), because the IPC wrapper may or may not pass the Electron event first.

A request outside a cluster goes through `httpGet` of `src/main/http.ts`,
which calls `Main.Util.fetch`, so it follows the proxy and certificate settings
of Freelens, and a TLS intercepting proxy needs nothing of the extension. Both
such requests are read-only `GET`s: the GitHub releases feed of
projectsveltos/sveltos (`src/main/latest-release.ts`, kept in the preferences
store for a day) and the chart logos (`src/main/chart-icons.ts`, kept in memory
per URL). Failures are not cached, so they are retried.

The Helm releases of a managed cluster are the exception. That cluster is not
in the Freelens catalog, so no proxy of the host reaches it, and
`Main.Util.fetch` takes no client certificate or TLS options.
`src/main/helm-release.ts` reads the release secret from the managed cluster's
API server with the Node `https` client (`http` for a plain server) and the
credentials of the managed cluster's Sveltos kubeconfig: server, CA, client
certificate and key, token or basic auth. The renderer reads that kubeconfig
from its secret in the management cluster and passes it in the request. A
kubeconfig whose user has an `exec` or `auth-provider` plugin is refused with
an error, which the view shows.

## CRD KubeObject Pattern

A model is a subclass of `Renderer.K8sApi.LensExtensionKubeObject`, one file
per kind and API version, in the directory of its API group:
`src/renderer/api/<group short name>/<kind>-<version>.ts`, with `config` for
`config.projectsveltos.io`, `lib` for `lib.projectsveltos.io` and `capi` for
`cluster.x-k8s.io`. `src/renderer/api/lib/sveltos-cluster-v1beta1.ts` exports
the class `SveltosCluster`.

The host reads the model's metadata from the class, through `static readonly`
properties. The objects it hands to the extension, in a list, a details panel
or a menu item, come from the host's store for the resource: they are instances
of the host's `KubeObject`, not of the extension's subclass. The methods of
`KubeObject` itself are there (`getName()`, `getNs()`,
`getCreationTimestamp()`, `getSearchFields()`); a method the subclass defines
is not, and calling it throws. So:

- **Metadata**: `static readonly` `kind`, `namespaced`, `apiBase` and `crd`.
- **Instance type**: `declare kind` and `declare apiVersion`, with the class's
  kind and version as literals. Two versions of a kind usually differ only in
  optional fields, and two kinds whose fields are all optional have the same
  shape, so without the literals their classes are assignable to each other,
  and `detailsFor` and `menuItemFor` accept a component written for the other
  model (see "Renderer Components"). `declare` emits nothing, so the runtime
  object is the host's as before.
- **Per-object logic**: a `static` method that takes the object, such as
  `SveltosCluster.getReady(object)`.
- **Fields**: read `object.spec` and `object.status` through the model's typed
  `SveltosClusterSpec` and `SveltosClusterStatus`.
- **Forbidden**: instance methods on the subclass; a fallback such as
  `typeof (object as any).getReady === "function" ? ...`, which always takes
  the fallback; `as any`.

```typescript
export class SveltosCluster extends Renderer.K8sApi.LensExtensionKubeObject<
  Renderer.K8sApi.KubeObjectMetadata,
  SveltosClusterStatus,
  SveltosClusterSpec
> {
  declare kind: "SveltosCluster";
  declare apiVersion: "lib.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1";

  static readonly kind = "SveltosCluster";
  static readonly namespaced = true;
  static readonly apiBase = "/apis/lib.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1/sveltosclusters";

  static readonly crd: SveltosKubeObjectCRD = {
    apiVersions: ["lib.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1"],
    plural: "sveltosclusters",
    singular: "sveltoscluster",
    title: "Sveltos Clusters",
  };

  static getReady(object: SveltosCluster): boolean {
    return object.status?.ready ?? false;
  }
}

export class SveltosClusterApi extends Renderer.K8sApi.KubeApi<SveltosCluster> {}
export class SveltosClusterStore extends Renderer.K8sApi.KubeObjectStore<SveltosCluster, SveltosClusterApi> {}
```

The file also exports a `KubeApi` and a `KubeObjectStore` subclass. The list
page uses the `KubeApi` type for `KubeObjectListLayout`; neither is
instantiated, because the store comes from the host, through
`SveltosCluster.getStore()`. `SveltosKubeObjectCRD`, in
`src/renderer/api/types.ts`, is the type of the `crd` of every model.

`src/renderer/index.tsx` registers the details panel of every kind
(`kubeObjectDetailItems`) and the Pause/Resume item of `SveltosCluster`
(`kubeObjectMenuItems`) with `Renderer.K8sApi.detailsFor` and
`Renderer.K8sApi.menuItemFor`, which take `kind` and `crd.apiVersions` from the
model class, and the pages (`clusterPages`) under a "Sveltos" group of the
cluster sidebar (`clusterPageMenus`, with `parentId: "sveltos"`): the overview,
and a page per kind. The page of a kind is made by `createAvailableVersionPage`
from its list pages, one per API version, newest first: it renders the first
one whose store the host has, and a "not available" message when the cluster
serves none. The Dependencies page is made the same way, from the
`ClusterProfile` model.

`customResources` lists the model classes of the kinds that have a page of
their own. The host reads the group and plural from each class's `crd`, and
while the extension is enabled it leaves the resource out of the Custom
Resources tree of the cluster sidebar, where it would otherwise be listed a
second time next to the extension's page. Every version of a kind names the
same group and plural, so one class per kind is enough. The definition stays
in the Definitions list, and the host's own list and details stay reachable by
URL and from the command palette. A model the extension only decorates, with a
details panel or a menu item and no page of its own, stays out of the field:
registered, it would leave the tree with nothing in its place. That is
`ClusterConfiguration`, which has a details panel only, and the ClusterAPI
`Cluster`, which belongs to ClusterAPI and which the Sveltos Clusters page
shows next to `SveltosCluster`. The host rejects an entry it cannot read (no
`kind`, no `crd` or `apiBase`, a core-group resource) with an error in the
log, and the resource stays in the tree (contract C6 of `api.md`).

The page it returns is an `observer`. `getStore()` reads the host's API
registry, which is observable, and the host registers a CRD's APIs only after
the cluster frame has loaded the CRDs. Freelens restores the last page when a
cluster is opened, so the page often renders before that; as an `observer` it
renders again when the version is served, and otherwise it keeps showing "not
available" until the user navigates away and back. Any component that chooses
a version through `getStore()` is an `observer` for the same reason.
`src/renderer/components/available-version.test.tsx` checks it: its spy on
`getStore` reads an observable, and the page follows when the test sets it.

### Adding an API

A new kind, or a new version of a kind, takes the same set of files as
`SveltosCluster`, one per version. The steps, in order:

1. **The types.** They follow the API of the controller that serves the
   resource, read from its sources at the release that serves the version,
   and not from memory: the Go types when the controller is written with
   kubebuilder, otherwise the `openAPIV3Schema` of the CRD.
   - Every Go struct has a TypeScript interface of the same name, with the
     same fields under their `json` names.
   - A field is optional in the interface when the CRD does not require it.
     `controller-gen` decides that from the markers, not from the `json` tag:
     `+required` (or `+kubebuilder:validation:Required`) makes the field
     required and `+optional` (or `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional`) makes
     it optional, whatever the tag says. A field without a marker is
     optional with `omitempty` and required without it, unless the package
     sets `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional`, which makes every such field
     optional. Current API conventions pair `+required` with `omitempty`, so
     `omitempty` alone does not make a field optional. When the types come
     from the `openAPIV3Schema`, a field is required when it is in the
     `required` list of its object. The generated CRD settles any doubt.
   - The API server validates every object against the CRD, so a required
     field is present. The one exception is a field that a newer CRD made
     required, on an object stored before; a list column or details panel
     shows `-` when it is missing, and the type does not allow for it.
   - Every `+kubebuilder:validation:Enum` (an `enum` in the schema) is a
     string-literal union type alias, used by the fields that have it, such
     as `SyncMode` in `src/renderer/api/types.ts`.
   - A type that several kinds or versions share goes to
     `src/renderer/api/types.ts` and has the fields of every version it
     covers, optional where one of them omits it.
   - A new version of a kind starts as a copy of the newest version's files;
     the diff of the Go types between the two releases says what changes.
2. **The model**, `src/renderer/api/<group short name>/<kind>-<version>.ts`
   (`config`, `lib` or `capi`, or a new short name for a new group), as in
   "CRD KubeObject Pattern": the class with the `static readonly` metadata, the
   `declare kind` and `declare apiVersion` literals, `static` helpers for the
   per-object logic, and the `KubeApi` and `KubeObjectStore` subclasses.
   `apiBase`, `crd.apiVersions` and `declare apiVersion` name the group and
   version, `crd` the plural, singular and short names of the CRD.
3. **The list page** per version in `src/renderer/pages/`, joined into one page
   per kind by `createAvailableVersionPage`, newest version first, and
   registered once in `clusterPages` and in `clusterPageMenus` under the
   "Sveltos" group. Its id goes into `listPages` of
   `integration/__tests__/sveltos-pages.tests.ts`.
4. **The details panel** per version in `src/renderer/details/`, registered in
   `kubeObjectDetailItems` with `Renderer.K8sApi.detailsFor` and the version's
   model class.
5. **Menu items** per version in `src/renderer/menus/`, registered in
   `kubeObjectMenuItems` with `Renderer.K8sApi.menuItemFor` and the version's
   model class, only for what the resource supports: a
   Pause/Resume item needs a pause field in its spec, as `SveltosCluster` has,
   and an action that annotates the object needs a controller that reads the
   annotation.
6. **`customResources`**: the model class of every kind that has a page.
7. **Tests** for the static helpers, next to the model, and for any logic in
   the page or panel; a member of the host that a test reaches goes into the
   stub, as small as the test needs.
8. **`README.md` and the fixtures**: a row in the "Supported APIs" table of
   `README.md`, and one in its table of pages for a new page; an object of the
   kind in `integration/fixtures/sveltos/objects.yaml`, in the namespace
   `integration-tests` when the kind is namespaced; and its CRD in the step of
   `integration-tests.yaml` that applies the CRDs, when the Sveltos chart does
   not have it.

Then check the result in Freelens dev ("Checking the Extension in Freelens
Dev"), with the CRDs and `integration/fixtures/sveltos/` applied to the test
cluster as `integration-tests.yaml` applies them: the page lists the test
object, the details show every field, the menu items work, and the resource is
gone from the Custom Resources tree.

## Renderer Components

- Pages and details panels are `observer` components from `mobx-react`, which the build maps to the host's copy.
- Every page, details panel and menu item renders inside an `ErrorBoundary` from
  `src/renderer/components/error-boundary.tsx`, a class component of the host's React with `getDerivedStateFromError`
  and `componentDidCatch`. It logs what its children throw while React renders them with `extension.name` and the
  component stack, and renders `ErrorPage` in place of a page or a details panel, and nothing in place of a menu item,
  where an error page does not fit. A details panel or menu item renders again when the host passes a new `object`,
  which is the boundary's reset key.
  - The boundary is applied where the registrations are made: `clusterPages`, `kubeObjectDetailItems` and
    `kubeObjectMenuItems` are mapped through `withPageErrorBoundary`, `withDetailsErrorBoundary` and
    `withMenuItemErrorBoundary`, each taking `this` and a registration, so an entry added to a field is wrapped as well.
    A `globalPages` field is mapped through `withPageErrorBoundary` too. Each field is annotated with its type from
    `Renderer.LensExtension` (`clusterPages: Renderer.LensExtension["clusterPages"] = [...]`), because the mapping
    refers to `this`, and its type would otherwise depend on itself.
  - The wrappers take the registration that `Renderer.K8sApi.detailsFor` and `menuItemFor` built, so the helpers check
    each component against its model first, with no cast.
  - A `try`/`catch` around the call of a component is not enough. It sees only what the call throws, and the errors
    that matter come later: a child component throws when React renders it, and a callback such as
    `renderTableContents`, `getItems` or `customizeHeader` of `KubeObjectListLayout` throws when the host calls it from
    its own render. Such an error goes up to the nearest boundary of the host: the one around the main area of a
    cluster for a list page, and the one around the whole cluster frame for a details panel or a menu item, because the
    host has none around the details drawer or a menu item of an extension.
  - The boundary has no decorators and no `observer`; it reads no observable, and the components inside it are
    observers of their own.
- Pages, details and menu items import their CSS module for the class names only, with no `?inline` import and no
  `<style>` tag; the rules reach the page through `renderer.css` (see "CSS"). SCSS variables are in
  `src/renderer/vars.scss`, used with `@use "../vars"`.
- SCSS modules get TypeScript declarations (`*.module.d.scss.ts`), written during the renderer build (see
  "CSS module declarations"). They are committed, because `pnpm type:check` and `type-check.yaml` run without a build;
  commit the regenerated file with a change to its SCSS module. `pnpm clean:dts` removes them.
- Icons are SVG files imported with `?raw` and rendered by `Renderer.Component.Icon` through its `svg` prop.
- The `kubeObjectDetailItems` and `kubeObjectMenuItems` registrations in `src/renderer/index.tsx` are made by
  `Renderer.K8sApi.detailsFor(SveltosCluster, { priority: 10, Details: SveltosClusterDetails })` and
  `Renderer.K8sApi.menuItemFor(SveltosCluster, { MenuItem: SveltosClusterPauseMenuItem })`, not written out with `kind`
  and `apiVersions`. The helper takes both from the model class and types the props of `Details` and `MenuItem` from
  it, so a wrapper that passes more props, such as `(props) => <Details {...props} extension={this} />`, needs no props
  annotation, and a component written for another model fails the type check. The
  check is structural: it tells two models of the same shape apart only by the `declare kind` and `declare apiVersion`
  literals of each ("CRD KubeObject Pattern").
- The props of a details panel are, or extend, `Renderer.Component.KubeObjectDetailsProps<SveltosCluster>`, and those
  of a menu item `Common.Types.KubeObjectMenuItemProps<SveltosCluster>`: the concrete model class, never `any`, and
  only what the host passes. A menu item does not extend `Renderer.Component.KubeObjectMenuProps`, the props of the
  host's whole `KubeObjectMenu` (`id`, `editable`, `removable`, `onMenuReady` and more). That compiles, because both
  require only `object`, and the item then promises props the host never passes.
- The host renders a cluster page with `params` only. A page that needs the extension gets it from the registration
  (`Page: () => <SveltosClustersVersionPage extension={this} />`), with the page component created once, outside the
  registration. `PageComponents.Page` is typed with the props the host passes, `Common.Types.PageComponentProps`, so
  the type check rejects a page that requires another prop. It does not reject one that declares another prop as
  optional next to `params`; that prop is `undefined`.
- The type check rejects `clusterPages` and `globalPages` registrations that would get `undefined` at runtime:
  - a component that requires props, passed as the page itself: `Page: createAvailableVersionPage(...)`, or
    `Page: MyPage` where `MyPage` takes `extension`;
  - a wrapper that declares the prop instead of passing it: `Page: (props: { extension: ... }) => <MyPage {...props} />`;
  - a page whose props type names its parameters (`{ params?: { query: PageParam } }`).

  Pass what the page needs from the registration, as above, rather than loosening the props type. A page that reads a
  named parameter takes `Common.Types.PageComponentProps` and reads `params.<name>.get()`: the host knows the names
  only from the registration's `params`, at runtime. The other registered components are typed the same way:
  `appPreferences` `Input` and `Hint` get no props, and a `kubeObjectMenuItems` `MenuItem` gets `object` and `toolbar`.
- A list page renders `KubeObjectListLayout`, which loads its store. A view that reads other stores, or more than one
  (the overview, the Sveltos Clusters and Dependencies pages, the profile details panel), loads them itself with
  `subscribeToStores` from `src/renderer/api/subscribe-stores.ts`, called inside an effect whose cleanup is the
  function it returns: `React.useEffect(() => subscribeToStores([clusterStore]), [clusterStore])`. It lists every
  namespace rather than the ones of the namespace filter, starts the watch only after the list has loaded, and reloads
  every 30 seconds, so that a failed list or a dropped watch recovers. It creates its abort controllers in the call,
  so the cleanup of a `React.StrictMode` run aborts only that run ("Rules That Fail Silently").
- What a cluster frame cannot do itself reaches main over IPC ("The main process"). `onActivate` in
  `src/renderer/index.tsx` creates the extension's `Renderer.Ipc` and sets the fetchers of `src/renderer/api/` that
  call it, one per channel of `src/common/ipc-channels.ts`: `setChartIconFetcher`, `setMetadataFilterFetcher`,
  `setHelmReleaseFetcher` and `setUiSettingsFetcher`. The overview gets the latest release from `getLatestRelease`,
  passed from its registration. Views call the fetchers, not `Renderer.Ipc`, and a channel added to main gets its
  fetcher set there too.

## Rules That Fail Silently

Each of these compiles when it is broken, and breaks the extension at runtime
or not visibly at all. The sections named in parentheses explain the
mechanism; this is the list to check a change against.

- **The host's React and mobx, one copy each.** Import `react`, `react-dom`,
  `mobx` and `mobx-react` by their bare module ids. A second React throws
  `invalid hook call`; a second mobx throws nothing, and the host never reacts
  to its observables. The build fails on the ways a second copy gets in
  ("Modules provided by the host").
- **Standard decorators.** An observable field is `@observable accessor`, and
  the class does not call `makeObservable(this)`. Without `accessor` the
  production build of mobx leaves the field unobservable; a unit test that
  imports the class fails ("Decorators").
- **No Node or Electron in renderer and common code.** They are `undefined` in
  the renderer. The build fails on an import, `pnpm type:check` on a global
  ("Process-specific settings").
- **One CSS asset, `dist/renderer.css`.** Any other name, or a second asset,
  leaves the extension unstyled. Nothing checks it; look at `dist/` after a
  change to the CSS setup ("CSS").
- **One tsconfig per environment.** Each program has only its runtime's `lib`
  and `types`, and no declaration may load Node into the renderer or the DOM
  into main; otherwise a wrong API type-checks and is `undefined` at runtime.
  The environment tests fail on a leak ("TypeScript").
- **No instance method on a KubeObject subclass.** The objects from the host
  do not have it, and the call throws. Nothing checks it
  ("CRD KubeObject Pattern").
- **A component that chooses the version through `getStore()` is an
  `observer`.** The host registers a CRD's APIs after the cluster frame has
  loaded the CRDs; a component that is not an `observer` and rendered before
  then shows the kind as not installed until the user navigates away and back.
  Only a test whose `getStore` reads an observable shows it
  ("CRD KubeObject Pattern").
- **`this.props` of an `@observer` class component only in its `render()`.**
  Under mobx-react 10 they are not observable. A `@computed` getter that reads
  them, or a method the host calls from its own derivations (`getItems` and
  `customizeHeader` of `KubeObjectListLayout`), throws
  `[mobx-react] Cannot read "X.props" in a reactive context` when the page
  renders, and the host shows its "App crash" page. The type check, the build
  and unit tests in a Node environment pass. Read the values in `render()` and
  hand them to the callback, or make the component a function component
  ("MobX 7 and mobx-react 10 (standard decorators only)" in Freelens's
  `migrating-from-v1.md`).
- **A memo over a store's items is keyed on something that changes with
  them.** The host keeps one observable array per store and updates it in
  place, with `replace` and `splice`, so `store.items` stays the same array
  while the objects in it change. A `useMemo` keyed on it, or on a prop that
  holds it, is computed once, and an open view keeps the objects it was opened
  with. An `observer` that reads the items while it renders follows them; a
  memo needs a key such as the ids and `resourceVersion`s of the objects. It
  shows only on a cluster whose objects change while the view is open.
- **An effect creates what its cleanup aborts or releases.** Freelens dev
  renders in `React.StrictMode`, which runs an effect, cleans it up and runs
  it again on the same instance. An `AbortController` kept in a `useRef` is
  aborted by the first cleanup, and every request of the second run with it;
  the host takes an aborted `loadAll` for no failure, so the view shows
  nothing and logs nothing. Create the controller, and the list of watches to
  release, inside the effect. The production build has no `StrictMode`, so
  only Freelens dev shows it, and only in a view that loads stores no other
  page has loaded before it.
- **Every page, details panel and menu item inside an error boundary.** A
  `try`/`catch` around the call of a component catches only what the call
  throws, not what a child throws when React renders it or what a callback of
  `KubeObjectListLayout` throws from the host's render. Such an error replaces
  the main area with the host's error, or, from a details panel or a menu item,
  the whole cluster view with the host's crash page. Map `clusterPages`,
  `kubeObjectDetailItems` and `kubeObjectMenuItems` through their wrappers in
  `error-boundary.tsx` ("Renderer Components").
- **A cluster page gets the extension from its registration.** The host passes
  `params` only. The type check rejects a page that requires another prop, but
  not one that declares it optional ("Renderer Components").
- **An ESM `main`, and the entries in `package.json` unchanged while
  `pnpm dev` runs.** The host refuses to reload a CommonJS main and logs why,
  and it watches only the entries it started with, so a manifest change needs
  Freelens restarted.
- **A bundled CommonJS package loads in the ESM main.** Main is built for
  Rolldown's `node` platform, which gives it a `require`, and defines
  `__dirname` and `__filename`. Without either, the package throws when
  Freelens evaluates `dist/main.js`, and the extension does not activate;
  `pnpm build` and `pnpm type:check` pass ("Process-specific settings").

Neither `pnpm build` nor `pnpm dev` runs the type check, so a Node global in
renderer code passes them; `pnpm type:check` and `type-check.yaml` catch it.

## Build

`vite.config.mjs` builds one entry point per run, in library mode, as ESM:
`vite build` builds the renderer and empties `dist/`, and `vite build --mode
main` builds main next to it. The two runs share no chunk; each bundle carries
its own copy of the `src/common/` code it imports. Nothing is minified.

`pnpm dev` runs the same two builds in watch mode, side by side, for a
directory install: the host reloads the extension when either entry is
rewritten. Its renderer run passes `--no-emptyOutDir`. In watch mode Vite
empties the output directory again before every rebuild, so a renderer rebuild
would delete `dist/main.js`, and the host would have no main entry to reload.

### Modules provided by the host

The host publishes its singletons on `globalThis.FreelensExtensionApi`, and
each process publishes only the ones it has. This is contract C3 of the
Freelens extension API (`docs/extensions/api.md`):

| Module id           | Global            | Published in |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `react`             | `React`           | renderer     |
| `react-dom`         | `ReactDom`        | renderer     |
| `react/jsx-runtime` | `ReactJsxRuntime` | renderer     |
| `mobx`              | `Mobx`            | both         |
| `mobx-react`        | `MobxReact`       | renderer     |
| `monaco-editor`     | `MonacoEditor`    | renderer     |

`build/vite-plugin-host-modules.mjs` replaces a bare import of one of these
with a module that reads the global, in the extension's code and in every
library it bundles. Its named exports are the members of the copy installed as
a devDependency, which is pinned to the host's version, so an import of a name
the host's version lacks fails the build. The plugin also fails the build on an
import of a host module that the process does not publish (`react` in main),
and on a subpath of a host package that the host does not publish
(`react-dom/client`, `react/jsx-dev-runtime`). Both would otherwise either read
`undefined` at runtime or bundle a second copy. A second React throws
`invalid hook call`; a second mobx throws nothing, and the host simply never
reacts to its observables.

Everything else is bundled. That includes `@freelensapp/extensions`, a shim of
three lines that reads `Common`, `Main` and `Renderer` off the same global; it
must not be mapped. The host installs no dependencies of an extension, so
whatever the code needs at runtime and the host does not provide has to be in
the bundle.

### Process-specific settings

- **Renderer**: nothing is external. Renderer code gets no Node or Electron, and
  an import of a Node builtin or of `electron` fails the build (Vite would
  otherwise replace it with an empty module and only warn).
  `process.env.NODE_ENV` is replaced at build time, because library mode
  leaves it for a consumer's bundler and the page has no `process`.
- **Main**: Node builtins (`node:*` and bare) and `electron` stay external.
  Bundled packages resolve with Vite's server conditions, so main gets their
  Node builds rather than their browser builds. Main is built for Rolldown's
  `node` platform (`build.rolldownOptions.platform`), the renderer for
  `browser`, the default of a Vite client build. A bundled CommonJS package
  `require()`s the builtins, and an ES module has no `require`: for the
  `browser` platform Rolldown turns the call into a `__require` shim that
  throws ``Calling `require` for "node:assert" in an environment that doesn't
  expose the `require` function`` as soon as the bundle is evaluated, and for
  `node` it defines `__require` with `createRequire(import.meta.url)`.
  `__dirname` and `__filename` are the other half: Node passes them to a
  CommonJS module, Rolldown leaves them as they are on either platform, and
  the ES module throws `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined in ES module
  scope`. Main defines them (`define`) as `import.meta.dirname` and
  `import.meta.filename`, the directory and file of `dist/main.js`, not of the
  package: a library that loads a file next to itself, such as a `.wasm`,
  finds it only when the build puts it in `dist/`.
  `pnpm build` and `pnpm type:check` pass either way, and nothing before
  Freelens evaluates `dist/main.js`, so on the wrong platform the extension
  fails only when Freelens loads it. A main bundle without CommonJS is the
  same on both platforms, byte for byte.

### Decorators

MobX 7 supports standard decorators only, and Oxc, which transpiles TypeScript
for Vite, passes them through unlowered, while neither Node nor Chromium runs
them yet. `build/vite-plugin-standard-decorators.mjs`, copied from Freelens,
hands every module with a decorator to esbuild first, which lowers the
decorators and their `accessor` fields. Both `vite.config.mjs` and
`vitest.config.ts` use it. A decorator that reaches the host or a test
unlowered is a syntax error when the module is evaluated.

An observable field is an `accessor` (`@observable accessor enabled = false;`),
and the class does not call `makeObservable(this)`. `@observable` on a plain
field type-checks and builds; the development build of mobx throws when the
class is defined, and the production build leaves the field unobservable.

### CSS

The host links the stylesheet named after the renderer entry, `renderer.css`
next to `renderer.js`. Library mode extracts the CSS of the whole bundle into
that one file (`build.lib.cssFileName`). A build that emits more than one CSS
asset, or a differently named one, leaves the extension unstyled. A component
imports its CSS module for the class names only and renders no `<style>` tag;
the rules reach the page through `renderer.css`. CSS modules
use `camelCaseOnly` class names.

### CSS module declarations

`build/vite-plugin-css-module-declarations.mjs` writes `x.module.d.scss.ts`
next to every `x.module.scss` the renderer build imports, in `vite build` and
in watch mode. It takes the class names from Vite's own `preprocessCSS`, with
the build's resolved config, so they are the names the bundle exports, after
`localsConvention`; a class inside `:global(...)` is not one of them.

The plugin is written so that a build cannot leave a committed declaration
empty or partial, whether it fails, is interrupted or is killed:

- it awaits its work in `transform`, so the build does not end while a write is
  pending;
- it writes a declaration only when the content changed, so a build that
  changes no stylesheet touches no file;
- it writes to a temporary `*.tmp` file next to the declaration and renames it
  over the declaration, which replaces it whole or not at all.

The plugin has no options and no dependency other than Vite, and it refers to
no path of this repository, so other extensions copy it unchanged.

## TypeScript

Main code runs in Node, renderer code in a browser page, and common code in
both. Each is type-checked in a program of its own, so that an API the runtime
does not have fails `pnpm type:check` rather than the extension:

| Config                       | lib                       | types                             | Files                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/main/tsconfig.json`     | ES2024                    | `node`                            | `src/main/`, `src/common/`                                         |
| `src/renderer/tsconfig.json` | ES2024, DOM, DOM.Iterable | `vite/client`                     | `src/renderer/`, `src/common/`                                     |
| `src/common/tsconfig.json`   | ES2024, WebWorker         | none                              | `src/common/`                                                      |
| `src/tsconfig.json`          | ES2024, DOM, DOM.Iterable | `node`, `vite/client`             | `*.test.ts(x)` under `src/`, and `test/`                           |
| `integration/tsconfig.json`  | ES2024, DOM, DOM.Iterable | `node`, `@freelensapp/extensions` | `integration/`                                                     |
| `tsconfig.json`              | ES2024                    | `node`                            | `vite.config.mjs`, the Vitest configs, `svgo.config.mjs`, `build/` |

All of them extend `tsconfig.base.json`, which has the compiler options of
Freelens's fixture extension: `strict`, `moduleResolution: Bundler`,
`useDefineForClassFields`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports` and `skipLibCheck`
among them. `skipLibCheck` is required: `extension-api.d.ts` is one declaration
for both processes and names DOM types and the `Electron` namespace, which no
single program has. Write `types` in every config; it decides which `@types`
packages a program sees.

### Main, renderer and common

The main and renderer configs both include `src/common/`. Compiled as main,
common code fails on the DOM; compiled as renderer, it fails on Node. What
passes both is valid in both, and that is the check that decides. Common code
uses only what both runtimes have: `globalThis.crypto`, `TextEncoder` and
`TextDecoder`, `URL` and `URLSearchParams`, `AbortController`,
`structuredClone`, and the timers, with the timer handle kept opaque.

`src/common/tsconfig.json` is for the editor, which gives a file to one config
only. Its `WebWorker` lib is the closest single match and an approximation:
`self` and `postMessage` compile there and fail in the main program.

The common program is not compiled on its own. `environment-tests/tsconfig.json`
extends `src/common/tsconfig.json` and keeps its `include`, so
`tsc -p environment-tests`, in `pnpm type:check:environments`, compiles
`src/common/` with the common settings, together with the probes. A program of
`src/common/` alone has no input when the directory has no source file, and
`tsc` stops on that (TS18003); the environment tests always have their probes,
so `pnpm type:check` passes with an empty `src/common/`. Keep
`src/common/tsconfig.json` even then: the editor uses it, and the environment
tests extend it.

The split does not cover the API namespaces: `Main` and `Renderer` compile in
every program, and the one the process does not have is `undefined` at runtime.
Common code uses `Common`.

### Asset imports

The renderer program has `vite/client`, which declares `*?raw`, `*?inline` and
the CSS modules and brings no Node into the program. With
`allowArbitraryExtensions`, `import styles from "./x.module.scss"` resolves to
the generated `x.module.d.scss.ts`, so a class name that the stylesheet lacks
fails the check. Without that file, after `pnpm clean:dts`, the import falls
back to the untyped declaration of `vite/client`.

### Environment tests

`types` and `lib` alone do not keep an environment pure. A declaration file
with `/// <reference types="node" />` loads all of `@types/node` into any
program that reaches it, whatever `types` says, and one with
`/// <reference lib="dom" />` loads the DOM. `environment-tests/` proves the
split holds:

| File             | Compiled with          | Must                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `node-apis.ts`   | renderer, common       | fail on every marked line |
| `dom-apis.ts`    | main, common           | fail on every marked line |
| `worker-apis.ts` | main                   | fail on every marked line |
| `shared-apis.ts` | main, renderer, common | pass                      |

Each line that must fail carries `// @ts-expect-error`, so a program that
starts accepting it fails with an unused directive. The configs there extend
the source configs and keep their `include`, so the probes are compiled
together with the sources and every declaration the sources reach. Compiled
alone, they would not see a declaration that a dependency of the sources brings
in.

When a declaration leaks, the environment tests fail; keep the leak out rather
than relax a probe. For Node
in the renderer, point `typeRoots` of the renderer config at a directory with
an empty `node` package, which a reference directive resolves to first. For
the DOM in main, remove the directive from the declaration with `pnpm patch`.

### Tests and tooling

Tests are not in the environment programs. Vitest runs them in Node, with
jsdom for files that ask for it, so `src/tsconfig.json` gives them the DOM and
Node. It sits in `src/` so that an editor finds it for a test file: the
environment config next to the test excludes it, and the editor goes on to the
next `tsconfig.json` up the tree. Tests compile against the real
`@freelensapp/extensions` declaration, while Vitest replaces the package with
`test/freelens-extensions.ts` at runtime.

No config declares the Vitest globals. TypeScript has no per-file globals, so
declaring `describe` or `vi` for tests would declare them for every file in the
program. Test and test-support files import what they use:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";
```

The module resolves from every program, so Biome keeps it out of the
extension's code: `style/noRestrictedImports` rejects an import of `vitest`
outside `src/**/*.test.*`, `test/` and `integration/`. The same rule rejects
there the testing helpers of React: the `act` named import of `react`,
`react-dom/test-utils` and `@testing-library/*`. They type-check, build and
pass the unit tests, which run the development build of React, but `act`
delegates to `React.act`, which the production build that Freelens runs leaves
out, so the call throws only in the host. `globals: true` stays on in
`vitest.config.ts` at runtime only, because React Testing Library registers its
automatic cleanup only when `afterEach` is a global.

`@freelensapp/extensions` is stubbed because the real package cannot run in a
test: it is a shim that reads `Common`, `Main` and `Renderer` off
`globalThis.FreelensExtensionApi`, which only the host sets, and it ships no
mocks. The `alias` in `vitest.config.ts` points the import at
`test/freelens-extensions.ts`, for the tests and for the extension code they
import. The stub covers only what the tests use, at runtime only; the type
check still uses the real declaration. So a test that reaches a member the stub
lacks compiles and fails on `undefined`: add the member to the stub, as small as
the test needs. The other host modules are not stubbed: `react`, `mobx` and
`mobx-react` resolve to the devDependencies, the host's versions.

Vitest runs the development build of mobx, so a test that imports
a class with `@observable` on a field without `accessor` fails when the class
is defined; `src/common/store/preferences-store.test.ts` relies on that.

The root `tsconfig.json` checks the tooling files. It has `checkJs`, so the
Vite config and the build plugins are type-checked too; give their function
parameters JSDoc types.

## Lint and CI

### Biome

`biome.jsonc` has the formatter, import groups and rules of Freelens. Two
overrides are specific to how the extension is laid out:

- `style/noRestrictedImports` keeps `vitest` and the testing helpers of React
  out of the extension's code (see "Tests and tooling").
- `correctness/noNodejsModules` rejects a Node builtin import in
  `src/renderer/` and `src/common/`, tests left out. It flags the import in the
  editor, before `pnpm type:check` does; it does not see Node globals such as
  `Buffer` or `process`, which only the type check catches.

Every path in an override starts with `**/`. Trunk runs Biome from a sandbox
outside the repository, with `--config-path` pointing back at `biome.jsonc`,
and there a path anchored at the repository root matches no file, so the
override silently does nothing. A plain `biome check` matches both forms, so
only `trunk check` shows the difference.

In that sandbox, Biome also cannot apply `vcs.useIgnoreFile`: since 2.5.15 it
matches every target against the repository's `.gitignore` and panics on a
path outside the repository root, so every file fails. The Biome commands in
`.trunk/trunk.yaml` pass `--vcs-use-ignore-file=false`, because Trunk applies
`.gitignore` itself before it picks the targets; `biome.jsonc` keeps the
setting on for `pnpm biome` and editors.

Renovate updates Biome, in the `biome` script and in `.trunk/trunk.yaml`, but
cannot run `biome migrate`. `biome-migrate.yaml` runs it on the Renovate
branch and commits the migrated `biome.jsonc` there, so that the update and its
migration are one pull request. The commit is by `github-actions[bot]`, which
`gitIgnoredAuthors` in `.renovaterc.json` lists, so that Renovate does not take
it for a manual edit and stop updating the branch.

Biome formats SCSS, YAML and Markdown too, as in Freelens, so Trunk runs no
Prettier or markdownlint; yamllint still checks YAML. The Kubernetes manifests
in `integration/fixtures/` are the exception: their sequences stay unindented,
as kubectl writes them, which Biome cannot do, so yamlfmt formats them with
`integration/fixtures/.yamlfmt.yaml`, and the ignore rules of
`.trunk/trunk.yaml` give them to yamlfmt only. `biome.jsonc` leaves them
out, together with `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which pnpm
writes, and `.trunk/`, whose `trunk.yaml` `trunk upgrade` rewrites.

The Markdown rules are in `nursery`. `markdown.parser.frontmatter` is on for
a Markdown file that starts with YAML frontmatter; without it Biome reads the
opening `---` as a thematic break and inserts a blank line after it. Biome does
not rewrap a paragraph, so a paragraph keeps the line breaks it is written
with.

### Knip

`pnpm knip:check` runs knip twice, for unused files and for dependencies: a
development pass over everything, and a `--production --strict` pass over the
code that reaches the bundles, which are the entries marked with `!` in
`knip.jsonc`. In the production pass only `dependencies` count, so a bundled
library that the extension's code imports belongs there. The host-provided
modules are devDependencies, for their types, and are ignored.

A file is unused when no entry reaches it: a leftover module, a barrel that
nothing imports. The production pass starts from the `!` entries only, so it
also reports a module that only tests import. The fix is to remove the file,
not to ignore it. The check does not include unused exports and types: on this
tree they are mostly the exported spec and status types of the models.

`knip.jsonc` lists the entries knip cannot find: the two source entries, the
Vitest alias target `test/freelens-extensions.ts` and the probes in
`environment-tests/`. Its Vite plugin is off: it adds the renderer entry of
`vite.config.mjs` as a development entry, which displaces
`src/renderer/index.tsx!`, and the production pass then skips the renderer.
`--no-config-hints` is set because one config serves both passes, and an entry
that only the production pass needs is reported as redundant by the other.

Two more settings keep the file check to real findings. `project` leaves out
the CSS module declarations with `!src/**/*.d.scss.ts`: TypeScript reaches them
through `allowArbitraryExtensions`, while knip resolves
`import styles from "./x.module.scss"` to the stylesheet, so nothing would
import them. The negation has no trailing `!`, which would apply it to the
production pass only. And the SVGO plugin is on (`"svgo": true`), so that
`svgo.config.mjs` is an entry: Trunk runs SVGO, and no dependency turns the
plugin on.

`ignore` leaves out `dist/**`. The `main` field of `package.json` makes
`dist/main.js` an entry once it exists, and the `knip` script runs with
`--no-gitignore`, so after `pnpm build`, which `check.yaml` runs first, knip
would analyse the bundle and report what it inlines from the libraries it
bundles: a `spawnSync("wsl.exe")` in a bundled `@kubernetes/client-node` comes
out as `Unlisted binaries: wsl.exe dist/main.js`. Run `pnpm knip:check` after a
build when changing `knip.jsonc`, as `check.yaml` does; without `dist/` the
problem does not show.

### Workflows

| Workflow                 | Runs                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type-check.yaml`        | `pnpm type:check`                                                             |
| `check.yaml`             | `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint:check`, `pnpm knip:check`                            |
| `unit-tests.yaml`        | `pnpm test:unit`                                                              |
| `trunk-check.yaml`       | `trunk check --all`                                                           |
| `integration-tests.yaml` | the integration tests in `integration/`, against Freelens dev                 |
| `mise-lock-check.yaml`   | on a change to `mise.lock`: no checksum changed for an unchanged tool version |

The type check has a workflow of its own, on pull requests and on pushes to
`main`, as in Freelens. It runs every program, tests, tooling and environment
tests included, which no build reaches, and a type error shows as its own
failed check rather than as a failed build. `check.yaml` builds without the
type check for the same reason, so it does not run twice.

The integration tests are not part of the extension API contract. They run in this
repository, under its own Vitest (`vitest.integration.config.ts`,
`pnpm test:integration`), against Freelens started with `pnpm dev` from a
freelensapp/freelens checkout. They attach to
it with Playwright's `chromium.connectOverCDP` on the port that script opens
(see "Checking the Extension in Freelens Dev"), so they need no package of
Freelens and no file of its checkout; Freelens dev is the only dependency, and
it is not in `package.json`. `playwright` is a devDependency at the version of
Freelens's catalog. The workflow builds the extension, checks out Freelens at
each release tag of its matrix (`v2.0.0`), applies the CRDs and the test
objects to the kind cluster (see below), starts `pnpm dev` in the Freelens
checkout in the background under `xvfb-run`, with its output in
a file and a fresh profile in `FREELENS_INTEGRATION_TESTING_DIR`, waits until
the CDP endpoint answers, and runs `pnpm test:integration` here. A profile of
Freelens dev syncs no kubeconfig by default, so the workflow seeds the fresh
one with a single sync entry, a file with the kind cluster alone, and the
catalog lists that cluster and nothing else. Every test
file is a session of its own on the one app, and fails on any error logged by
either process:

- `extensions.tests.ts` uninstalls whatever installation of the extension the
  app has, installs this checkout in place from the Extensions page and opens
  its preferences page, without changing the preference: the extension's tab
  in the "Extensions" tab group shows the title and the input placeholder of
  its `appPreferences` entry. It needs no cluster.
- `sveltos-pages.tests.ts` opens the kind cluster and every page of the
  extension from the "Sveltos" group of the cluster sidebar, the overview
  first: it is the first view of the cluster, before any list page has loaded
  a store, so that an effect that loads nothing under `React.StrictMode` shows
  there, and it waits for the overview's cards. The session then selects the
  test namespace and opens each list page by the id of its `clusterPageMenus`
  entry, waiting for the page's root (the list, the dashboard, or the "not
  available" message) and checking that no error page of the error boundary is
  rendered. Each page is an `it` that navigates from the sidebar itself. Then it
  opens the details panel of a row of every list page, the dashboards aside,
  and checks that no error page is rendered there either. It does not check
  the columns, the menu items or the Custom Resources tree. With
  `TEST_SCREENSHOT_DIR` set, it saves a screenshot of every page there, named
  by the page's id, for a look at the pages and not for the assertions. It
  keeps an in-place installation of this checkout that is enabled, and
  installs it otherwise.

The tests are deterministic, so nothing retries them: the config sets no
`retry`, and the workflow runs the step once, under `timeout 600`. A retry
repeats the same failure, and every view of a session waits its full timeout
before it fails.

The sessions reach the app through its renderer only; the main process, and
with it the application menu, is out of reach of CDP. They navigate the root
frame with `Renderer.Navigation.navigate` of the extension API, find the kind
cluster with `Renderer.Catalog.catalogEntities` by its name, `kind-<name>`,
and connect it by navigating to `/cluster/<id>`. `browser.close()` of a
browser connected over CDP closes only the connection, so a session ends with
it and the app keeps running. The renderer's console carries the errors of the root frame and of
every cluster frame; the main log is read from the file that
`FREELENS_MAIN_LOG` names, from its size when the session started, and every
line that starts with `error:` counts, also after a task prefix that turbo
may add, such as `freelens:dev:`, except
`proxy_server.go:… Error while proxying request: context canceled`, which the
Kubernetes proxy of Freelens logs for a request that the renderer aborts.
Freelens dev renders in `React.StrictMode`, which mounts every view twice and
aborts the requests of the first mount, so the line comes and goes with the
timing of a run; it names no request and says nothing about the extension.
Without the variable only the renderer is checked. A renderer error carries its location, line and column included,
and the worker that logged it. Its text is the preview of its arguments, which
is empty for some objects and only the class name for others, such as
`ErrorEvent`; such an error is described from its arguments, read from the
page, and an empty one without arguments, which the browser itself logs, gets
its time, to find it in the main log.
The workflow sets `TURBO_LOG_ORDER=stream` for `pnpm dev`: in GitHub Actions
turbo otherwise groups the output of a task until it ends, and the persistent
`dev` task never ends, so the log would stay empty.

The sessions read the cluster and change nothing in it: they apply and delete
no CRD and no object. The workflow prepares the kind cluster before Freelens
starts. It applies the CRDs of the kinds the pages list, not the Sveltos
controllers: the CRDs of the `projectsveltos` Helm chart, rendered with
`helm template --include-crds`, and the ClusterAPI `Cluster` CRD of the last
ClusterAPI release that serves v1beta1, the version the extension reads. Once
they are established, it applies `integration/fixtures/sveltos/`: the
namespace `integration-tests` and one object of every kind that a page lists,
the namespaced ones in that namespace. No controller runs, so the objects have
no status. Vitest runs the files one at a time (`fileParallelism: false`), in
no set order, and none depends on another having run.

The pages session selects `integration-tests` in the namespace filter of the
extension's Profiles page, which its `KubeObjectListLayout` renders for a
namespaced resource, unless the filter already shows it: a new cluster shows
only `default`, and the app keeps the selection for every namespaced list of
the cluster. Without it the namespaced list pages list nothing. The session
opens no page of the host, whose requests can log errors of their own: the
Pods page asks for pod metrics, and kind has no metrics server. Its teardown
closes the connection and then checks the errors.

The code the sessions share is in `integration/__tests__/extension-helpers.ts`:
connecting to the app with the error collector, installing the extension,
opening the kind cluster and the "Sveltos" group of its sidebar, selecting the
test namespace, and the selectors. Its
name does not match `*.tests.ts`, so Vitest does not collect it.
`integration/tsconfig.json` compiles the directory with Node and the DOM,
because the callbacks of `page.evaluate` run in the page, and with the types
of `@freelensapp/extensions`, which declare `globalThis.FreelensExtensionApi`
for them.

Four variables configure the sessions. `FREELENS_CDP_URL` is the CDP
endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:9223` by default), `FREELENS_MAIN_LOG` the main
log, `TEST_KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` names the kind cluster (`kind` by default,
`freelens` in the workflow), and `TEST_SCREENSHOT_DIR` the directory of the
screenshots of the pages session (none by default); every kubectl call names
its context, `kind-<name>`, so a run never acts on the current context. The
checkout to install is found from the location of the helpers. Outside
CI a session skips with a warning when Freelens dev does not answer or the
cluster is not reachable; in CI (`CI` set) the run fails instead, so that a
mistake in the workflow does not turn into a silent skip.

Run locally, the tests act on the profile of Freelens dev, `FreelensDev`,
which is apart from that of an installed Freelens: they navigate its window,
leave this checkout installed in place, uninstalling another installation of
the extension, and leave the kind cluster connected, with the namespace
filter set to `integration-tests`. They touch no other cluster of the
catalog. The profile lists the kind cluster only once its kubeconfig is in
"Kubeconfig Syncs" (see "Checking the Extension in Freelens Dev"); without
it the pages session fails on the timeout of finding the cluster. Apply the
CRDs and `integration/fixtures/sveltos/` to the kind cluster first, with the
commands of the step of `integration-tests.yaml` that applies them and the
context of the kind cluster.

## Checking the Extension in Freelens Dev

The functional checks of a change run against Freelens started with
`pnpm dev` from a freelensapp/freelens checkout. That script starts Electron
with `--remoteDebuggingPort 9223`, so an agent can drive the app over the
Chrome DevTools Protocol. How to attach Playwright MCP to it is in Freelens's
`DEVELOPMENT.md`, "Inspecting the running dev app from an AI agent"; start
Freelens before the session connects. Playwright MCP writes its snapshots to
`.playwright-mcp/`, which is git-ignored. Added to a Claude Code session that
is already running, the server is listed as connected, but its tools appear
only in a new session.

Without the MCP server, or until that new session, a script with
`chromium.connectOverCDP("http://127.0.0.1:9223")` of `playwright`, a
devDependency, does the same, as the integration tests do. `browser.close()`
of such a browser closes only the connection; the app belongs to Freelens and
keeps running.

A profile of Freelens dev syncs no kubeconfig until one is added in
"Kubeconfig Syncs" of the Kubernetes preferences, so its catalog lists none of
the developer's clusters; `KUBECONFIG` does not change that. For the checks,
add a kubeconfig with the test cluster alone, such as the output of
`kubectl config view --minify --flatten --context kind-kind`. A fresh profile,
in a `FREELENS_INTEGRATION_TESTING_DIR` under the system's temporary
directory, can start with it already in place: `integration-tests.yaml` seeds
`FreelensDev/lens-user-store.json` there with
`preferences.syncKubeconfigEntries`, whose `filePath` is absolute ("Kubeconfig
syncs of the dev profile" in Freelens's `DEVELOPMENT.md`).

### Installing the checkout

1. `pnpm install`, then `pnpm build`. After a branch switch, `node_modules`
   can still hold another stack, and Freelens loads the extension from
   `dist/`.
2. On the Extensions page, enter the checkout's directory and press
   "Install". Freelens then asks whether to load the extension in place;
   confirm that too. The table lists the extension as enabled, with
   "development" in the version column and `Loaded from <directory>` in its
   title.
3. A rebuild, by `pnpm build` or by `pnpm dev` of the extension, reloads it
   once in the root frame and once in each cluster frame.

### Driving the UI

- Every cluster renders in a cross-origin `<clusterId>.renderer.freelens.app`
  iframe. Pages, menus and details of the extension live in that frame, not
  in the main page.
- Pages of the extension have URLs like `/extension/<name>/<pageId>`, with the
  package name's `@` dropped and `/` turned into `--`, for example
  `/extension/freelensapp--sveltos-extension/sveltos-overview`. The sidebar entries
  navigate in `onClick`; their `href` is not the page URL. A click on an
  entry's `[data-testid="sidebar-item-…"]` element does not navigate; a DOM
  `click()` on the link inside it, `[data-testid="link-for-sidebar-item-…"]`,
  does. Neither does `history.pushState` in the cluster frame.
- The root frame navigates with `Renderer.Navigation.navigate(url)` of the
  extension API, run in its page: `/extensions`, `/catalog`,
  `/preferences/extension/<name>`, `/cluster/<id>`. The application menu
  belongs to the main process, which CDP does not reach.
- Playwright's actionability checks can fail on the hotbar, where
  `#ScrollSpyRoot` intercepts pointer events; a DOM `click()` on the element
  works.
- Views fill in once the host's stores have loaded. Wait for the expected
  content, not a fixed time, before deciding that a page is empty.

### Reading the console

The renderer console also carries the output of Freelens's terminal dock
(`%cMESSAGE` lines), which can include the user's shell prompt, account names
and paths. Keep only warnings, errors, page errors and the extension's own
lines, and never paste the full console into a PR, an issue or a report.
React reports key problems as console errors ("Each child in a list should
have a unique key", "Encountered two children with the same key"); they count
as failures of the "no error in DevTools" check.

The renderer's requests to Kubernetes go through Chromium, which logs every
response that is not a success as a console error,
`Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of N`, also one
that the code that sent it handles. The text names no URL; the location of the
message does, and the error collector of the integration tests appends it. An
extension whose tests expect such a response on purpose, a 404 or a 409, leaves
out that one error by its status and URL, not every "Failed to load resource".

The main process logs to the terminal running Freelens, and to a file. On
macOS it is `~/Library/Logs/Freelens/lens.log`, with the renderer's
`lens-renderer-*.log` next to it; when the terminal is not at hand, it shows
the extension's activation, its reloads and its own lines. Filter it as the
console.

## Agent Skills

The skills for porting a Freelens extension to the v2 API and for creating a
new one are in `skills/` of freelensapp/freelens-example-extension.

## Code Style

- **Biome** formats **TypeScript/TSX, JS, JSON, CSS, SCSS, HTML, YAML, Markdown**: double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, 2-space indent, 120 char line width; use `pnpm biome:fix`
- **Trunk** formats **TOML and shell scripts**, and runs the linters for formats not covered by Biome (yamllint, actionlint, shellcheck); use `pnpm trunk:fix`
- Import order (enforced by biome organizeImports): built-in modules → `@freelensapp/**` → packages → relative paths
- React 19; JSX compiles to `react/jsx-runtime` imports, which the build maps to the host's React
- **No emoji** in Markdown files (`.md`), comments, or any source code

## Security

Never read, display, reference, or include the contents of the following files in any response or context, even if they are open in the editor:

- `.env`
- `.env.*`
- `.envrc`
- `.npmrc`
- `*.jks`
- `*.keystore`
- `*.p12`
- `*.pfx`
- `*.pem`
- `*.key`

The same list is git-ignored in `.gitignore` and enforced for Claude Code by
the `permissions.deny` rules in `.claude/settings.json`, which block reading
and editing these files. Change all three together. The rules are native
permissions rather than a hook on purpose: a hook runs a process in the
working tree, which may be an untrusted pull request, and an interpreter such
as `python3 -c` imports modules from that tree before the hook's own code.

## Electron Multi-Process

Extensions run in the same multi-process model as the Freelens host:

- **Main process** (`src/main/`): Node.js environment, extension lifecycle, cluster connectivity
- **Renderer process** (`src/renderer/`): Chromium browser, UI components

Code in `src/common/` is shared between both processes.

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Appearing

1. Check that files are not in ignored output directories (`dist/`, `node_modules/`)
2. Full clean and rebuild: `pnpm clean:all && pnpm install && pnpm build`
3. With a directory install and `pnpm dev` running, look for a refused reload in the Freelens log, and restart
   Freelens after a change to `main` or `renderer` in `package.json`; reinstall an extension installed from a tarball

### Build Failures

1. Check for TypeScript errors: `pnpm type:check`
2. Check for linting errors: `pnpm lint:check`
3. Verify dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Check Node.js version matches the `engines` field in `package.json`

### Runtime Errors

1. Open Freelens DevTools and check the Console tab for renderer errors
2. Check the terminal where Freelens was launched for main process errors
3. Look for stack traces with file:line numbers
4. Verify all CRD objects have proper `static readonly` properties (kind, apiBase, crd)
5. Validate both with `pnpm type:check` **and** `pnpm build`: runtime failures can appear only in bundled `dist/` code

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic search** to find examples and patterns in the codebase
2. **Follow existing patterns:** grep for similar implementations before creating new ones
3. **Test changes** before committing
4. **Run validation before committing:** `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm type:check && pnpm test:unit`
5. **For TypeScript/TSX, JS, JSON, CSS, SCSS, HTML, YAML and Markdown files:** run `pnpm biome:fix` (or `biome check` directly if `biome` is installed locally)
6. **For other formats:** run `pnpm trunk:fix` (or `trunk check` directly if `trunk` is installed locally)
7. **Full build** when in doubt about cached state: `pnpm clean:all && pnpm install && pnpm build`
8. **Do not use Anthropic Fable for coding tasks:** Fable may be used only for planning,
   analysis, and thinking through problems. When writing or editing code,
   use standard editing tools instead.

## GitHub Actions (Claude Code Action) Rules

This project has a Claude Code workflow (`.github/workflows/claude.yaml`) triggered
via `@claude` comments on issues, PR comments, and reviews. When operating via that
workflow, follow these rules:

### Code Review

When reviewing code and proposing fixes:

1. **Show the diff first:** present every proposed change as a unified diff
   block using the `diff` language tag:

   ```diff
   --- a/path/to/file.ts
   +++ b/path/to/file.ts
   @@ -10,7 +10,7 @@
    const oldLine = "before";
   -const changedLine = "after";
   +const changedLine = "the fix";
    const unchangedLine = "same";
   ```

   You can generate this from the terminal with:

   ```bash
   git diff -u -- path/to/file
   ```

   If the change spans multiple files, group them under a single commit
   subject and show each file's diff sequentially.

2. **Propose a commit subject first:** before any code change, output a
   single line with the proposed commit subject:

   ```text
   **Proposed commit:** <short description>
   ```

   Do **not** use Conventional Commits prefixes (e.g. `fix:`, `feat:`,
   `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`). This project prefers
   plain, descriptive commit messages and PR titles without any prefix.

   Wait for the user to confirm (or adjust) the subject before applying the
   change.

3. **Comment style:**
   - Keep review comments concise and actionable
   - Reference specific lines (file + line number) when pointing out issues
   - Offer a concrete fix suggestion rather than just flagging a problem
   - Do **not** use emoji in any Markdown, comments, commit messages, or
     PR descriptions. The only exception is emoji that already appears
     inside code strings (e.g. application logs, user-facing messages).
   - Use GitHub's `suggestion` block for small targeted fixes so the PR
     author can accept the change with a single click:

     ```suggestion
     <same unified-diff format as shown above>
     ```

   - For larger multi-file changes, use `diff -u` blocks in a regular
     comment instead, with the proposed commit subject shown first

### Making Changes to a PR

When asked to implement a change on a PR:

1. Propose the commit subject (as above)
2. Describe what will change and why
3. After confirmation, apply the changes with commits on the PR branch
4. **One commit per fix:** when a review surfaces more than one issue or
   the plan includes more than one fix, apply and commit each fix
   separately. Do not batch multiple independent fixes into a single
   commit. This keeps the history bisectable and makes each change easy
   to revert individually.

### Force-Pushing a Rewritten Branch

When you are asked to rebase a pull request branch, or to rewrite its
history in another way (amend, squash, drop a commit), push the result with:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD
```

The push wrapper the action names in its instructions, `git-push.sh`, accepts
no flags, so it cannot do this; `git` itself is allowed in this workflow.
Do not fall back to merging `main` into the branch instead: a merge commit is
not what was asked for.

Force-push only the pull request branch the run was invoked on, and only when
the request calls for a rewrite. Never force-push `main` or any other branch,
and never rewrite a history you were not asked to.

### Modifying GitHub Actions Workflows

Claude cannot push changes to files under `.github/workflows/` directly,
because the GitHub token used by the action lacks the `workflows` permission.
Any patch to a workflow file MUST therefore be delivered as a new, complete
file under the `github-workflow-fix/` directory in the repository root instead
of editing the file in place:

1. Write the full, final contents of the workflow to
   `github-workflow-fix/<workflow-file-name>`, with the same file name as in
   `.github/workflows/` (e.g. `github-workflow-fix/check.yaml`). Do **not**
   edit the original file under `.github/workflows/`.
2. Make it a **complete** file (the entire workflow as it should look after
   the change, not just a diff or fragment), so it can be copied verbatim.
3. Commit it with the change that needs it, and list it in the report. In the
   PR description, note it as a proposed workflow change that a maintainer
   must move from `github-workflow-fix/` to `.github/workflows/`.

A maintainer moves the file into `.github/workflows/` in a separate commit and
removes `github-workflow-fix/`. Pull before continuing on the branch, as it may
have gained such a commit.

### Branch Naming Conventions

When creating a branch from an issue, use a human-readable name that includes
the issue number and a short slug derived from the issue title:

```text
claude/issue-<number>-<short-slug>
```

- `<number>` is the GitHub issue number
- `<short-slug>` is a kebab-case summary of the issue title, kept short
  (3 to 6 words maximum, omit articles and filler words)

Do **not** use auto-generated timestamp suffixes (e.g.
`claude/issue-1957-20260612-2108`): these are not human-readable and make
branch lists hard to scan.

### Fork PRs: Review Only

A PR from a fork (different owner than `freelensapp`) gets a review and
nothing else: no commits, no pushes, no branches. Its code is untrusted, and
the head of a fork PR can change between the moment a maintainer looks at it
and the moment the workflow checks it out, so nothing taken from the checkout
may reach `freelensapp/freelens-sveltos-extension`.

When a fork PR needs changes, a maintainer first copies the exact commit they
reviewed to a branch in this repository. From then on it is a
same-repository PR, which gets the full setup and the normal workflow. The
copy is made either locally (`gh pr checkout <N>`, then push the branch) or
by the Claude Task workflow, following "Copying a Fork PR" below.

### Copying a Fork PR

This applies to a Claude Task run whose prompt asks to copy a fork PR and
names the PR number and the full commit SHA to copy. It is a git-only task:
do not check out, read, build or run any of the PR's files, and do not
describe its changes, because they are untrusted input.

1. `git fetch origin refs/pull/<N>/head`.
2. Verify that `FETCH_HEAD` equals the given SHA. If it does not, or no full
   SHA was given, stop and report the actual head without pushing anything.
3. `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/claude/pr-<N>`.
4. Open a PR from `claude/pr-<N>` to `main`. It MUST use the **exact same
   title** as the original PR, copied verbatim with no prefix, and its body
   is `Copy of #<N> at <sha>.` followed by the usual footer.
5. Comment on the original PR with a link to the new one.
